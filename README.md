## 📁 Repository Structure 

This repository is organized to enhance your learning experience by structuring resources into weekly lessons. Each week focuses on a specific theme, building upon the concepts learned previously:

- **Weekly Folders (`weeks/`)**: Each folder represents a week's worth of training and includes:
  - **`README.md`**: A detailed overview of weekly topics, setup instructions, objectives, and goals.
  - **`lab.ipynb`**: An interactive, step-by-step notebook designed for hands-on practice of weekly topics and training.
  - **`quiz.md`**: A short quiz to test your understanding of the week's concepts.
  - **`assets/`**: Presentations, documentation, and supplementary materials.

- **`src/`**: Reusable and modular code for exercises and projects throughout the five weeks.

> **Note**: Visit the [CURRICULUM](./CURRICULUM.md) for a detailed, week-by-week plan.
