## In-Class Activities üõ†Ô∏è
This session guides you through building a low-code chatbot using Azure AI Foundry and Azure OpenAI. Below is an overview:

### Configuring Azure AI Services
- Set up foundational services, including Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Document Intelligence.
- Enable data ingestion and indexing capabilities in Azure AI Search for your project.

### Data: Contoso Employee Handbook
- The folder `assets/contoso_data` contains PDFs with employee benefits, handbook policies, and other related materials.
- These documents will be used to showcase Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling the chatbot to provide data-driven answers.

### Developing the Chatbot
- Use Contoso HR documents as sample data to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Integrate vectorized and contextual indexing with Azure AI Search to retrieve precise and relevant responses.
- Deploy and test the chatbot, leveraging the OpenAI reasoning engine to answer user queries based on the embedded Contoso data.

## Assignments üìù
- **Homework**:
  - Reproduce the in-class chatbot deployment.
  - Upload sample data from the `assets/contoso_data` folder and index it using Azure AI Search.
  - Implement hybrid search, combining vector-based and keyword-based retrieval.
  - Enable question-answering capabilities using Azure OpenAI as the reasoning engine.
- **Due Date**: Before the start of Week 2.
