## Overview üìã
In Week 2, we focus on advancing your knowledge of Azure AI by exploring orchestration frameworks like Microsoft‚Äôs **Semantic Kernel**. You will also learn how to enhance chatbot functionality with multimodal AI integration, enabling the processing of multiple data types such as text, images, and documents.

### Defining the AI System Framework:
This week introduces the concept of an **AI System** as a composite system where the **Large Language Model (LLM)** acts as the central processing and reasoning engine, seamlessly orchestrating calls to multiple Azure AI services. We will demonstrate this by building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that integrates various services and capabilities into a unified pipeline.

#### What is RAG?
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a system design pattern that combines information retrieval (retrieving relevant data from structured or unstructured sources) with generation (leveraging LLMs to synthesize and respond to user queries). This pattern ensures:
- Contextual and accurate responses by grounding the LLM in real-world data.
- Improved performance by narrowing the scope of generative tasks through retrieved evidence.

### Key Focus:
- **Pro-Code Indexing and Customization**: We enhance the chatbot from Week 1 by implementing advanced, code-driven indexing in Azure AI Search. This provides flexibility and precision in managing search and retrieval pipelines.
- **Semantic Kernel Integration**: Leveraging the orchestration capabilities of Semantic Kernel, we unify multiple services, including Azure AI Vision, Content Understanding, and Azure OpenAI, enabling multimodal AI capabilities.
- **Dynamic System Design**: The AI system is designed to dynamically adapt its LLM usage and retrieval strategies based on user queries and context, exemplifying a highly scalable and efficient architecture.

This hands-on session equips you with the tools and knowledge to build and operationalize a cloud-native AI system, showcasing the power of **Semantic Kernel** in orchestrating Azure AI services to create intelligent, scalable solutions.


## Learning Objectives üéØ
- **Master Orchestration Frameworks with Semantic Kernel**: Gain a deep understanding of how Microsoft‚Äôs Semantic Kernel enables seamless coordination of multiple Azure AI services to build scalable and intelligent AI systems. 
- **Build a Vector Database in Azure**: Create and manage a vector-based data store laveraging Azure AI Search, leveraging integrated vectorization for efficient indexing and searching.  
- **Enable Multimodality in Your Chatbot**: Incorporate text, images, and other data types to provide a richer, more dynamic user experience.  
- **Build a Backend Orchestration Framework**: Establish a robust architecture that coordinates services and tasks for our chatbot.  
- **Develop a Front-End with Streamlit**: Implement a streamlined interface that interacts with backend  microservices and components, facilitating a fully functional AI solution.
